# Results

## Sample of paper results

You can find in this folder a part of our results experiments.

### TransAppPretrained Folder

This folder contains saved model parameters for pre-trained TransApp in a self-supervised way on the CER publicly available data.

- Folder None: only consumption series given in input of the model.
- Folder Embed: with temporal features encoded given in input of the model.

### TransAppResults Folder

This folder contains saved model parameters and metrics results for TransApp model trained to detect a "cooker" appliance in the consumption series.

- Folder None: only consumption series given in input of the model.
- Folder Embed: consumption series and temporal features encoded given in input of the model.

### ModelComparaison Folder

This folder contains saved model parameters and metrics results for other classifiers, **Inside** and **Outside**, our proposed Appliance Detection Framework. The results are also shown for the "cooker" appliance detection case.

- Folder None: only consumption series given in input of the model.
- Folder Embed: consumption series and temporal features encoded given in input of the model.

### AblationStudy Folder

This folder contains saved model parameters and metrics results for Ablation Study experiments.
