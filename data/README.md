# CER Dataset

## Download the dataset

You may find more information on the ISSDA website on how to download the dataset. As mentioned on the ISSDA website, to access the data, please complete the [ISSDA Data Request Form for Research Purposes](https://www.ucd.ie/issda/t4media/ISSDA_Application_Research_V5.1.docx), sign it, and send it to ISSDA by [email](issda@ucd.ie).
For teaching purposes, please complete the [ISSDA Data Request Form for Teaching Purposes](https://www.ucd.ie/issda/t4media/ISSDA_Application_Teaching_V4.docx), and follow the procedures as above. This covers sharing of data with students in a classroom situation. Teaching requests are approved on a once-off module/workshop basis. Subsequent occurrences of the module/workshop require a new application. If students subsequently use data for projects/assignments, they must submit their request form for Research Purposes. Please get in touch with us if you have any queries.
Data will be disseminated on receipt of a fully completed, signed form. Incomplete or unsigned forms will be returned to the data requester for completion.

### Download the preprocessed dataset

For this project, we preprocessed the CER dataset. The preprocessed version of the dataset can be found here:

It is important to note that the request to access CER data from the ISSDA (see the procedure above) have to be completed even though you are using the preprocessed dataset.

## Preprocesssing

After cloning the repo, copy the three folders ("Inputs", "Labels" and "ExogeneData") from the preprocessed dataset link in this folder.
